Hi everyone - 

My name is Neil and I am a geochemist passionate about all things data. I have been an environmental consultant for over five years and have gravitated towards data discovery, advanced analytics, and effective visualiations. My primary data analysis platform has been R, and I am working on increasing my proficiency in Python. Looking forward to sharing some of my work with you all.

Best,
